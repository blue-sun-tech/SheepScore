- table ignores starting scores when sorting

- extra [b][/b]

- rts claims something about resubmitted answers not changing? (something with invalids?)
- need to re-group answers when a player's answers were changed

===================

bugs:

- when you add entries before q's, entries disappear
- when you modify someone's entry, regroup the modified ones
- says "didn't find any entries" when you reload the same entries file
- when adding >1 new players manually, sometimes answers don't get saved

TODO:

- also get entry time
- bold bonus scores (incl. for aces)
- rounding options: none, nearest, up, down (only apply to base scores. not bonuses)
- add "override" bonus option. also bonus / penalty (maybe ?)
- edit group name manually
- format for <b>bold text</b>
